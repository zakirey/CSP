# CSP

CSP implementation for AIMA Constraint Satisfaction Problems Exercise 10(Map-Coloring with N number of points) and Zebra Problem. It has basic user interface where different heuristics and inferences could be set for solution. For Map Coloring user can set number of points, grid width and height as well as distance between points.
